# Mediocre  senior highschool student

This blog is a futile effort by me to actually get working on something rather than lazing around. I'm not good in anything in particular, but I have a knack for learning about things which I am never going to understand completely and information which I might not use in my life. I want to put my random browsing skills to some use through this blog. 

I mostly spend my time watching Youtube videos or reading blogs. Lately I have been watching a lot of anime shows, having completed around 30 shows till now (I started watching from the middle of 2020). When I was small, I liked to browse through the pages of various encyclopedias, admiring the pictures and the random bits of information that were written there. This might have led me to have the interest in learning about random things.

You can contact me through the the icons in the homepage.
