# WELCOME TO MY FIRST POST

I read a lot of blogs from my favourite creators to figure out what I should write as my first post. Most of the creators start directly writing about a subject without a *"this is my first post"* but I don't have any idea noted or researched to write right away.

This is the `customary` first post blog. I wrote this only to check if I can write markdown.

I am so confused on what I should be writing that I am writing that I am confused.

**I am writing in bolds.** <br>

*I am writing in italics.*


## TOOLS FOR CREATING THIS SITE

I created this site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and an awesome theme called [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod).
